I am a Masters student in Industrial Engineering,a first class honours graduate in Mechanical Engineering ,a computer and data enthusiast. I have two years of academic experience in data manuplation and analysis.I’m currently working as a graduate research assistant where I worked with a huge medical database created by MIT consisting of 500 million records to extract information using python integrated with PostgreSQL and analyses the anomalies in the database. During my undergrad studies, I worked as a research assistant where I analyzed a company’s supply chain and suggested ways to improve them. I have also worked as a data analyst intern at caterpillar where I extracted data from the companies database to analyze how the price of a tube is quoted. 

## Education

## Work Experience

#### January 2019 - Present - Research Assistant - Northeastern University - Boston, MA

- Extracted data from the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database created by MIT containing 500
million records using PostgreSQL and python.
- Performed a details literature review of over 50 research papers in order to understand the current knowledge including
substantive findings, as well as theoretical and methodological contributions in the field of Drug Overdose.
- Analyzed the database to find anomalies in the database and determine how these anomalies can help in better understanding
of the healthcare system and the patients.

#### June 2016 - June 2018 - Research Assistant - Sri Venkateshwara College of Engineering - Chennai, India

- Designed, created, and tested a strategic model for the Manufacturing industry that analyses the environmental risks
involved in a manufacturing plant.
- Created comprehensive literature reviews of over 1,000 research papers using Google Scholar.
- Analyzed small and medium scale industries data to resolve distribution bottlenecks and to add robustness with the help of
mathematical modeling, proposed changes to the network for reducing the inefficiencies of the supply chain

#### June 2017 - August 2017 - Data Analyst Intern - Caterpillar Inc - Chennai, India

- Extracted data from the SQL database containing around 60,000 records into excel and cleaned the data.
- Designed correlation and factors analysis model that determined the relationship between various variables and separate
the major 5 factors which affect the price quotes by a supplier.
- Determined the major factors involved in the price quotation provided by the suppliers using regression modeling.

## Relevant Projects

#### October 2018 - December 2018 - Statistical analysis of Tornadoes from 1950 to 2018 in the US

- Pre-processed and cleaned a large dataset of over 64,000 records and 25 attributes from NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction
Center database through Web scraping in R to analyze the tornado risk at different locations in the united states.
- Performed Kernel density estimation analysis to find the regions which had a high risk of tornados and find the time during
the day tornados are prone to occur. 

#### December 2017 - April 2017 - Analysis of implementation of lean six sigma in SME

- Conducted a survey and collected 5,000 responses from over 70 small and medium scale companies, Preprocessed the
data.
- Developed a model to find the critical success factor which affects the implementation of lean six sigma in small and
medium scale industries and conducted a factor analysis to filter out 10 most critical factors.
- Designed correlation and regression models that analyze the relationship between variables and the relationship between
the dependent and independent variable.
