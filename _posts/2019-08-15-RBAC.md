**Database Purpose**

The purpose of this database is to maintain data (such as user/employee details,
roles/groups that they may belong to, SAML authentication/SSO for users etc.) of various
employees/users across the enterprise. This data shall be used for 2 purposes

```
● To enable authentication during login and for SSO (Single Sign-on) using SAML
authentication.
● Restriction of resource access such that employees have access rights or
permissions only to the information they need to do their jobs effectively and
prevent them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.
```
This information will be used and managed only by the security (or RBAC) team within

the enterprise.

**Business problems addressed**

```
● Controls access of sensitive and non-sensitive data amongst the employees of the
enterprise. Consequently improves compliance to say federal, regulatory laws
related to privacy and sensitive data access.
● Ensures easy and accurate onboarding of new employees by creation of accounts
and access rights and reduces the need for paperwork
● Ensures that such access rights and permissions provided to employees across
various platforms remain up-to-date.
● Controls modification of access and permissions as per the change in the role of an
employee.
● Controls revocation of access rights when an employee leaves the company.
● Effective management on a granular level, by consolidating employee access
rights to set of roles and user groups. And hence increases operational efficiency.
```

**Business Rules**

```
● Each user can be associated with one or more accounts (or services).
● Each user can be associated with one team and one department only.
● Each Department can be associated one or more teams and each team may have
one or more users.
● Each account or service can be associated with
    ○ One or more users
    ○ One or more roles
    ○ One or more user_groups
    ○ One or more SAML authentication config attributes.
    ○ One or more permissions
● Each role
    ○ May have access rights to one or more accounts or services.
    ○ Can be associated with one or more users
● Each user_group will have also
    ○ May have access rights to one or more accounts or services.
    ○ Needs to contain one or more users.
● Each SAML_authentication_config
    ○ May contain certificates/attributes to authenticate one or more accounts (for
    example, a single SAML authentication xml can be generated for all
    Google services like gmail, google docs etc. for a given user.)
● Each permission can be associated with one account only.
