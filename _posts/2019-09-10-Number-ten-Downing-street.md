The Downing Street complex is a four storey Grade-I and II listed brick built Georgian terraced townhouse. 
It is a home to the Prime Minister and her family, and a busy office and workplace for the PM and her support staff. In 1732 the first-ever PM Robert Walpole refused to accept the house as a personal gift from King George II. Instead he insisted it be used by future First Lords of the Treasury. 

In 1735 the architect William Kent connected No.10 Downing Street to a larger house at the rear of the property (erected in 1677) facing Horse Guards Parade. 100% of PMO’s electricity supply is on a green tariff, generated from renewable sources.

Since 2013, 10 Downing Street has reduced the usage of electricity dramatically. Between 2013 and 2017, the average electricity usage dropped from 75,7 to 57,8 kwH.
