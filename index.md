Data, I think, is one of the most powerful mechanisms for telling stories. I take a huge pile of data and I try to get it to tell stories.

A data interpreter, business analyst, and information manager with a proven history of turning large data sets into progressive ideas through the creation of summarized analysis, clear, compelling infographics, maps, data visualizations, and interactive media.

I am an enthusiastic Industrial Engineering graduate student possessing a humungous potential to learn advanced technologies and adapt to a new environment. I have experience of working with large datasets for two years in academic fields.

In my capacity as a Northeastern Decision Analytics lab research assistant, I use statistical analysis to investigate trends in MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) databases, My work was part of a research task to bring meaningful insights from the large, freely available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

I am very keen on obtaining a Business Analyst / Data Analyst Role, offering analytical and critical thinking skills to help generate innovative ideas and gain industry experience.
